# Application Workflows

## Overview

This document outlines the key user flows and application workflows in the Gista iOS application. Understanding these workflows is crucial for developers to maintain and extend the application functionality.

## Core User Flows

### 1. Onboarding Flow

**Purpose**: Introduce new users to the application and handle registration/sign-in.

**Components**:
- `LaunchScreen.swift`: Initial branded loading screen
- `OnboardingView.swift`: Main onboarding UI with sign-in/register options
- `AppleSignInButton.swift`: Social sign-in component

**Flow**:
1. App launches and shows the launch screen
2. System checks for existing authentication
3. If user is not authenticated, the onboarding view is presented
4. User chooses to sign in or register
5. User completes authentication
6. On success, user is directed to the main content view

### 2. Content Discovery Flow

**Purpose**: Allow users to browse and discover content.

**Components**:
- `ContentView.swift`: Main container view
- `LibraryView.swift`: Primary content browsing interface
- `SearchView.swift`: Content search functionality

**Flow**:
1. User navigates to the Library tab in the main interface
2. Content is presented in categorized collections
3. User can scroll through available content
4. User can tap on the search icon to access search functionality
5. User can search for specific content
6. User can select content to view details

### 3. Content Consumption Flow

**Purpose**: Enable users to view and interact with content.

**Components**:
- `PlaybackView.swift`: Content viewing interface
- `MiniPlalyerView.swift`: Minimized content playback
- `MyResourcesView.swift`: User's saved content

**Flow**:
1. User selects content from the library or search results
2. Content details are displayed
3. User initiates content playback
4. User can control playback (pause, resume)
5. User can minimize playback to continue browsing
6. User can save content to their resources

### 4. Content Sharing Flow

**Purpose**: Allow users to share content with others.

**Components**:
- `SharedContentService.swift`: Handles content sharing functionality
- Extension integration for sharing from other apps

**Flow**:
1. User selects share option on content
2. System share sheet is presented
3. User selects sharing method
4. Content is shared with selected recipients
5. OR: User shares content from external app to Gista
6. Shared content is processed and added to the user's library

### 5. User Profile Management Flow

**Purpose**: Allow users to manage their profile and settings.

**Components**:
- `UserProfile.swift`: Profile management interface
- `Settings.swift`: Application settings

**Flow**:
1. User navigates to profile section
2. User can view and edit profile information
3. User can access application settings
4. User can manage preferences
5. User can sign out

## Application States

### 1. Unauthenticated State

- Launch screen is displayed
- Onboarding flow is accessible
- Limited functionality available
- Authentication options presented

### 2. Authenticated State

- Full application functionality available
- User-specific content is loaded
- Library and search are accessible
- User profile is populated

### 3. Content Playback State

- Content is being viewed/played
- Playback controls are available
- Mini player may be visible during navigation

### 4. Background State

- App may continue playback in background
- Background tasks may run
- Notifications may be processed

## State Management

The application uses a combination of state management approaches:

- **@StateObject**: For view-specific state
- **@EnvironmentObject**: For shared state across multiple views
- **UserDefaults**: For persistent user preferences
- **SwiftData**: For structured data persistence

## Navigation System

Navigation is managed through the `NavigationManager` class, which provides:

- Consistent navigation patterns
- Deep linking support
- Navigation stack management
- Screen transitions

## Error Handling and Recovery

Each workflow includes error handling and recovery mechanisms:

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Provide retry options
   - Offer alternative authentication methods

2. **Network Errors**:
   - Retry mechanisms for transient errors
   - Offline mode for previously loaded content
   - Background synchronization when connection is restored

3. **Content Errors**:
   - Fallback content options
   - Error reporting to analytics
   - User feedback mechanisms

## Shared Content Integration

The application supports receiving shared content from other applications:

1. Content is shared to Gista from another app
2. `SharedContentService` processes the incoming content
3. Content is validated and categorized
4. Content is added to the user's library
5. User is notified of the new content
